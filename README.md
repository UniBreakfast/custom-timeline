# [custom-timeline](https://github.com/UniBreakfast/custom-timeline)

### Custom static method `Date.customTimeLine()` to run and follow alternative timelines with custom speed/position

## Also a Clock class to display time

### And an ultimate TimeLineControls class with every control I could think of

The idea behind this project was to make module(s) to allow developers to manually control time for anything from games with time control and to application testing that would not require to wait a lot or go through the hustle of changing system time in your OS.
